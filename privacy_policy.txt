PRIVACY POLICY

INFORMATION WE COLLECT

When you register in our app we collect the following information: username, email, password (which gets encrypted and hashed), and IP address.

When you add/submit a quote we store that text in our database.

REPORTING CONTENT

We have placed a mechanism to report content you do not find suitable. If a quote does not belong to you, you will see an icon "!" that will let you report that post. You will be required to type in a reason for reporting. Once the report is submitted you will not longer see that post ever again. We also get notified via email of a reported post. We will review your report and take appropriate action such as removing the post from our server and banning/removing the user account.

ACCOUNT TERMINATION

We reserve the right to delete or ban your account for any reason without notice to you. Abusive users will be banned from our service and their account may be deleted.

ADS

We display ads in this app that take up the whole screen. We use google admob to load and show ads in this app.
